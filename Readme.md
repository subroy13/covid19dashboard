# Covid 19 Tracker

`A Dashboard for Prediction and Control assistance and management of resources in view of Covid-19 pandemic, sponsored by IIM, Vishakhapatnam`

‘COVID-19 Tracker’ is a web application (dashboard) to visualize COVID-19 situations across different states and districts of India, and is primarily focused on developing prediction for the infected and recovered people under different hypothetical scenarios.

‘COVID - 19 Tracker’ primarily helps predicting the spread of COVID based on a modified extended e-SIR model. It analyzes districts and state levels and represents a prediction of COVID-19 spread for various scenarios with different possible dates of lockdown relaxation, followed by varying degrees of social distancing guidelines that may be adopted post-lockdown. It also proposes possible strategies to contain the COVID-19 spread in each district depending on fraction of the population that will be infected at the peak. That can help to manage the medical supply chain management.
